# CSSO: Scaleform

I present to you all my grandest thing I've ever done since I started modding for source offensive. this is a project that replaces the HUD in source offensive v1.1 with scaleform style (at least crica 2018)

inspired by [abandonedpool's scaleform hud for csgo demos](https://github.com/abandonedpools/scaleform)
